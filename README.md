# CAM-for-Alternans-Control

(1ï¼‰ 'Constant BCL', 'Constant DI', 'Constant TR' are used to do the simulations and generate data.
(2) 'subfunction' contains sub functions required to run the simulation.
(3) 'create movie' in the 'subfunction' is used to create a video of cardiac waveform.
(4) The four 'figure' functions are used to analyze the results after simulating the control approaches.
(5) It is suggested to run the codes on a workstation or GPU which has high memory to deal with a lot of data.
